# Unity_FPS_Game

In this project we made an FPS Survival Zombie Game with Unity.

We do weekly presentations to our teacher and I add them "Weekly_Presentations".

In SRS pdf we explain our development,tasks and goals.You can find everything in it.

Presentation video: we explain codes,design and show game playing with Turkish language.
Video takes about 20 minutes.

ZombieRun file has all scripts,codes,assets,libraries etc. You should open it
with C# Unity. ZombieRun.sln is the solution file.
